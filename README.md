# Data Cleanser Project

## Overview
The **Data Cleanser** project is designed to clean and preprocess raw data using SQL. It helps remove inconsistencies, duplicates, and incorrect formats, ensuring data accuracy and reliability. The project is useful for data analysts, database administrators, and developers handling large datasets.

## Features
- Identify and remove duplicate records
- Standardize formats (e.g., dates, phone numbers, addresses)
- Handle missing values efficiently
- Validate data integrity constraints
- Optimize query performance for cleansing tasks

## Requirements
- SQL Server / MySQL / PostgreSQL (specify the DBMS used)
- Basic knowledge of SQL querying
- A dataset requiring cleansing

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-cleanser.git
   ```
2. Import the database schema and sample data:
   ```sql
   source setup.sql;
   ```
3. Configure connection settings in the `.env` file or directly in your SQL client.

## Usage
1. Run individual cleansing scripts:
   ```sql
   source remove_duplicates.sql;
   source standardize_formats.sql;
   ```
2. Execute the full cleansing pipeline:
   ```sql
   CALL clean_data_procedure();
   ```
3. Review the cleansed data:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM cleaned_table;
   ```

## Customization
- Modify cleansing rules in `config.sql`
- Adjust validation constraints for specific data types
- Extend functionality by adding more procedures
